## Project title
Linguist App for Women Who Code App Deploy Challenge

### Project description
Simple Starter project based on the greeting card exercise in the Android Basics With Compose learning guide.
The goal is to create an Android App using a Google API. I had no experience with Android, Kotlin, 
or mobile so I only was able to launch a basic app in the time allotted with little functionality.

### Project requirements
This project does not have any networking capability and so it cannot be currently used to connect to 
the Google Translate API.
